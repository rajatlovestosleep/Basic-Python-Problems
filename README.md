# Basic-Python-Problems
# 🐍 Python Assignment – Strings, Lists & Logical Problem-Solving

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook covering a set of foundational Python exercises focused on **string manipulation, list operations, indexing techniques, and basic logical challenges**.
All problems and solutions are implemented directly within the notebook.

## 🔡 String-Based Tasks

* Text replacement using `.replace()`
* Concatenating strings
* Counting vowels *without* loops
* Checking whether a string is a **palindrome**
* Using negative indexing effectively
* Handling user input and applying string transformations
* Removing duplicate characters
* Converting between lists and strings
* Splitting words into lists

## 📋 List-Based Tasks

* Finding the **minimum** and **maximum** values
* Cyclically swapping elements from the start and end
* Swapping the first and last elements
* Calculating the **sum** and **average** of long lists
* Basic list manipulation and traversal techniques

## 🎯 Key Learnings

This assignment strengthened my understanding of:

* Python’s built-in string and list functions
* Indexing and slicing (including negative indices)
* Problem decomposition and clean code structure
* Using Jupyter Notebook for iterative problem-solving
* Approaching simple algorithms with both clarity and efficiency

## 🚀 How to Run
